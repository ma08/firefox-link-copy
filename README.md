##Google Search, Facebook Chat and Hangouts(in Gmail)- Link Copy - (For Firefox)

This is just a firefox version of [chrome-link-copy](https://github.com/ma08/chrome-link-copy)

I was fed up of the redirection urls google gives on its search results - making it a chore to copy the link address.
As I am now using firefox as the default broswer, I decided to write the firefox
version of this add on



A tiny extension for `Firefox` to make copying links from google pain free.
Generally when you right click a link on google search and select
`Copy Link Address`, the url copied is google's redirecting url and not the original url.
It looks like this `https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCMQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FLed_Zeppelin&ei=DFHnU8_mK4Hi8AXqpIDAAg&usg=AFQjCNHIjSJNblTZM7fbhcTkrPNp14SnKw&sig2=L95WqCRVToubyMsGNnBFWg&bvm=bv.72676100,d.dGc`

So I introduced an extra option in the contextmenu for google search links, `Copy real link`, using this you can copy the original link without any alteration.

Using this extension, the copied link is this

Works for Google Search, Google Images, Facebook Chat, Hangouts in Gmail
